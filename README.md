# a11yTO Theme README:

Hi. I'm a11yTO's WordPress theme, developed from a starter theme called `_s` -- or `underscores`, if you like. a11yTO did the following to me so I could help them do what needs to be done:

- Added Grunt functionality to handle and minify `CSS`, as well as minify `JavaScript` through Sass and Uglify respectfully. Simply clone/ download me to your local WordPress themes folder and run `npm install` in that same folder on the command line to download what Grunt needs to run and handle said tasks.
