# a11yTO Theme README:

Hi. I'm a11yTO's WordPress theme, developed from a starter theme called `_s` -- or `underscores`, if you like. a11yTO did the following to me so I could help them do what needs to be done:

- Added Grunt functionality to handle Sass specifically (for now) to further make my `CSS` easier to work with. Simply clone/ download me to your local WordPress themes directory and run `npm install` on the command line to download what Grunt needs to run and watch Sass.
